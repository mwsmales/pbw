# Personal Blog Website Project

An example of a personal blog website, with a main page and an exmaple blog post page.  Responsive across desktop, tablet and mobile.

My first attempt creating a website of this size from scratch.  Visual design is not a strength of mine, so the colour scheme and styling needs a little work...

This is a project created for the Udacity frontend nanodegree.
